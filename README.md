## Purpose Of The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](https://i.ibb.co/3sJxmKT/Screenshot-1.png)

To incentivize customers to spend more, delivery costs are reduced based on the amount spent.
Orders under $50 cost $4.95. For orders under $90, delivery costs $2.95. Orders of $90 or more
have free delivery.
They are also experimenting with special offers. The initial offer will be “buy one red plate, get
the second half price”.
